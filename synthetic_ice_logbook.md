# Title : Synthetic Ice Core Logbook


## Updated heat jacket, pulley system and stepper motor setup

The heat jacket used when freezing the synthetic ice core is being lifted by a pulley system connected to a stepper motor. The controls of this pulley system and stepper motor has been updated (summer 2024) with a custom PCB and controller case.

The custom PCB has been designed in the ECAD suite of Autodesk fusion ({see files here}(https://github.com/vgkinis/synthetic_ice_core/tree/main/Fusion_PCB_Project/ECAD_files). The Gerber files from the ECAD project has then been sent to JCLPCB in China (delivery with DHL priority plus).

See images of of the ECAD PCB:
